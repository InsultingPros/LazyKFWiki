At the moment of year 2021, Killing Floor 1's [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1250/workshop/) has several serious issues.

1. You can subscribe to 50 items at max, if you hit the limit, Steam will download nothing. This issue can't be fixed by any mod, TWI need to fix their game. So keep an eye on your subbed item count.

2. Even if you have less than 50 subbed items, workshop can stop working for you randomly. Aka, steam downloads something, but files are not extracted and you can't access them from ingame menu / install directory.

For second part you can try few workarounds.

* Stop the game if it's running.
* Subscribe, check if Steam downloaded anything.
* Start the game.
* Start a solo game (faster than joining a multiplayer), play for a wave and disconnect to main menu.
* Files extraction should start and a notify will pop on top right corner.

If this doesn't work, congrats, you are unlucky and have to do the xtraction manually. Download the [KFTempArchiveExtractor](https://github.com/Mateos81/KFTempArchiveExtractor/releases/), which is based on [cmicroc's guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=291724762).

Or ask authors to provide download link, so you can install mods manually.
