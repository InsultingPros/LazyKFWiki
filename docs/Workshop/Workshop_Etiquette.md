## Credits

No matter what you used and how much, you must always give credits to authors. No exeptions.

## Text Description

### Too laconic / chaotic

Put some structured text, don't be shy. If you put one word and leaves us forever, that will lead to many questions in comment section and a huge waste of time for everyone. Besides that people are gonna react much better to easily readable and informative description, than to anything else.

For lazy people there is a nice [template](../Workshop/Workshop_Tmpl.md) that you can use and easily modify.

### Textwalls

Being the opposite is not better, try not to be this [guy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1644743621) - 9000 letters, and less than 1% is informative and useful.

## Tags

* Do not be that moron who spams tags and uploads some hot garbage ([Example #1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529309260)).
* Do not put tags that are not related to your upload ([Example #2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1657657476)).

This leads to not being able to quickly find something that you really type, and is a dick move in general.

* If you upload a **map**, tag it as `map`, and maybe `co-op`, `single`, `multiplayer` at max.
* If you upload a **video ad replacement** maybe put `misc`, `art` and few similar ones.
* tbd.
